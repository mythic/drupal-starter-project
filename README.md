# ðŸ¦„ Drupal Starter Project by Mythic Digital ðŸ¦„

_This file is a work in progress._

Starting a new Drupal project can seem intimidating. We believe that Drupal
projects should be as simple as possible to keep our team moving as quick as
possible.

This starter project is a collection techniques acquired over the years working
with Drupal for enterprise organizations.

## Getting started

This project can be installed to your machine using Composer:

```bash
$ composer create-project mythic/drupal-starter-project drupal-project-name
```

_Note: Change `drupal-project-name` to your project's name._
